* Breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county.
* County which had the largest number of votes.
* Breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes received by each candidate.
* The winning candidate  including their vote count and their percentage of total votes.

## Resources
* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.8
* Visual Studio Code 1.52.1
